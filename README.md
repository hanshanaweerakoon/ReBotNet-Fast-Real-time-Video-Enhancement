# ReBotNet
Real time video Video Restoration &amp; Enhancement Network



ReBotNET is a PyTorch-based deep recurrent network for video enhancement and restoration tasks, including denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution. It leverages temporal memory and spatio-temporal attention to produce smooth, consistent, and high-quality video frames across sequences.

## Key Features
- Recurrent temporal connections for motion continuity and temporal consistency  
- Multi-task support: denoising, deblurring, and video super-resolution  
- PyTorch implementation with modular, research-ready code  
- Config-driven training and inference setup  
- Evaluation metrics: PSNR, SSIM, and temporal consistency  
- Supports large model files via Git LFS (`.pth` checkpoints)
